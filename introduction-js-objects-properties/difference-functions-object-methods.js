// As you learned in earlier modules, functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task

function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
console.log(greet("Alice")); // "Hello, Alice!"

// Object methods, on the other hand, are functions that are associated with an object. 
// They are defined as properties of an object and can access and manipulate the object's data. Here's an example of an object with a method

console.log("\n"); /////////

const person = {
    name: "Bob",
    age: 30,
    sayHello: function() {
        return "Hello, my name is " + this.name;
    }
};

console.log(person.sayHello()); // "Hello, my name is Bob"

// In this example, sayHello is a method of the person object. The this keyword allows the sayHello method to 
// access the properties of the object named person. You will learn more about the this keyword in future lessons.

// A difference between functions and methods is how they are invoked. Functions are called by their name, 
// while methods are called using dot notation on the object they belong to. For example, we call the greet function as greet("Alice"), 
// but we call the sayHello method as person.sayHello().

// Another important difference is the context in which they operate. Regular functions have their own scope,
// but they don't have a built-in reference to any particular object. Methods, however, are bound to their object 
// and can access its properties and other methods using the this keyword.
