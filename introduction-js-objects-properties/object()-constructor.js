// In JavaScript, a constructor is a special type of function used to create and initialize objects. 
// It is invoked with the new keyword and can initialize properties and methods on the newly created object.

// In this lesson, we will take a look at how to work with the Object() constructor. 
// The Object() constructor creates a new empty object. Here is an example

new Object()

// When you call new Object(), it returns a new object that can be used to store values.

// The Object() constructor can be used with or without the new keyword. When called as a function without new, 
// it behaves differently depending on the type of value passed to it. Here's an example of using the Object() constructor without the new keyword

const num = 42;
const numObj = Object(num); // Creates an object wrapper for the number

console.log(numObj);
console.log(typeof numObj); // "object"

// As you can see in the second console.log, numObj is an object. 
// This is happening because we used the Object() constructor to turn that input of a number into an object.

// What happens if we try to pass null or undefined to the Object() constructor?

console.log("\n"); ///////////////

const newObj = new Object(undefined);
console.log(newObj); // {}

// Well, the result will be an empty object. Another use case for the Object() constructor is when you're working 
// with a value of unknown type and you need to ensure it's an object. Let’s take a look at the following example

console.log("\n"); ///////////////

function toObject(value) {
  if (value === null || value === undefined) {
    return {};
  }

  if (typeof value === "object") {
    return value;
  }

  return Object(value);
}

console.log(toObject(null));

console.log(toObject(true));

console.log(toObject([1, 2, 3]));

// In this example, we have a function called toObject. The second condition will check if the value is 
// a type of object and will return the value if the condition is true. This condition will check for objects as well 
// as arrays since arrays are special types of objects.

// If neither of the conditions is true, the function returns Object(value), 
// which converts the input into an object. This works for values like numbers, strings, and booleans

// Most of the time you will not be using the Object() constructor to create new objects because you will 
// be using object literal syntax instead (e.g., const objectLiteral = { name: "Beau" }). But it is still good to 
// understand the basics of working with the Object constructor.
