// JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight, text-based data format 
// that is commonly used to exchange data between a server and a web application.

// One of the reasons why JSON is so popular in web development is because it is both machine-parseable and human-readable.

// Since JSON is language-independent, you can easily send JSON data from a Java application to a Python application, 
// or from a JavaScript application to a C# application.

// JSON supports many data types including objects, arrays, strings, booleans, null, and numbers.

// Here's an example of a JSON object

//{
  //"name": "Alice",
  //"age": 30,
  //"isStudent": false,
  //"list of courses": ["Mathematics", "Physics", "Computer Science"]
//}

// As you can see, JSON uses key-value pairs to store information and each pair is separated by a comma. 
// Each key must be wrapped in double quotes, otherwise you will get an error.

// To access data from a JSON object, you can either use dot or bracket notation. 
// In this example, we are using dot notation to access the age from the JSON object

import data from "./example.json" with { type: "json" };

console.log(data.age);

// This particular example is using what is known as an import statement, which 
// imports the JSON object into this file so we have access to it. You will learn more about the import statement in a future lesson.

// You can also use bracket notation to access information from JSON objects. Here is an example of accessing the list of courses array

console.log("\n"); ////////////////////

import data from "./example.json" with { type: "json" };

console.log(data["list of courses"]);

// Using bracket notation is particularly useful here because the key contains multiple words separated by spaces. 
// If we tried to use dot notation, it would result in an error.
