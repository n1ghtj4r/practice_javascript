// The optional chaining operator (?.) is a useful tool in JavaScript that lets you safely access 
// object properties or call methods without worrying whether they exist. It's like a safety net for working 
// with objects that might have missing parts.

const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
};

console.log(person.name); // "Alice"
console.log(person.job); // undefined

// In this example, person.name exists, so it logs Alice. But person.job doesn't exist, so it gives us undefined.

// Now, let's say we want to access a property of an object that might not exist

const person_1 = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
};

// console.log(person_1.address.street); // This will throw an error! //////////////////////////////////////

// This example will throw an Uncaught TypeError. Since person.address is undefined, we are not able to access the street property. 
// This is where the optional chaining operator comes in handy. Here is an example of using the optional chaining operator:

const user = {
  name: "John",
  profile: {
    email: "john@example.com",
    address: {
      street: "123 Main St",
      city: "Somewhere"
    }
  }
};

console.log(user?.profile?.address?.street); // "123 Main St"
console.log(user?.profile?.phone?.number);   // undefined

// By using the optional chaining operator, we are telling JavaScript to only continue with the operation if the object 
// (or the value before the ?.) exists and is not null or undefined.

// If the value before the ?. is null or undefined, JavaScript returns undefined rather 
// than attempting to proceed with the operation and throwing an error.
